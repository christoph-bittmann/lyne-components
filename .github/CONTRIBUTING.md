# Contributing

## Our contribution model

Lyne Design System is an **open source** project at SBB-CFF-FFS. We foster
open and inclusive design and development. If you're wondering more about our
contribution process, you're in the right place. First off, thank you for your
interest!

**Since we are in very early development phase, contributions are limited to the core Lyne team. But once this project will be more mature we invite
the community to participate and contribute to the Lyne Design System.**

## Code of conduct

We value all of our community members, and thus want to foster a positive
contributing environment. Please take a look at our
[code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before engaging in our workspaces.
