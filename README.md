<h1 align="center">
  Lyne Components
</h1>

> Lyne Components are the building blocks of the Lyne Design System
> and are based on standard compliant [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/specs)
> compiled by StencilJS and browsable through Storybook

## Todo
- in travis, build logs are cluttered. Lower log level for semantic-release/npm publish and npm install -g netlify-cli
- Rename package name to "lyne-components"
- Decide for Branching-Model
- Add Merge Checks
- Add Linter
- Repo -> Insights -> Community -> Fullfill checklist
- Prevent push to master
- npm script ```start``` runs stencil and storybook in parallel. We need sequential. Problem is that ```start:stencil``` has no exit code since it is serving and watching, so the second sequential command ```start:storybook``` is not run. Quick fix is to run them parallel.
- npm script ```start``` runs 2 node scripts. To exit (stop the 2 servers), dev's need to press ctrl&c 2 times. Optimize it.
- Different secrets and env-variables on git, travis and netlify.
  - Document exactly which key is needed for what and where to generate it
  - Before production: regenerate all keys
- for DEPLOYMENTS.md: in which timezone should we format the date?
- DEPLOYMENTS.md might get large over time. Should we limit it to x releases?
- build_release_urls.js -> check if there is a limit in the deployments request. Do we get the latest 50? 100? Do we get all? Probably, we need to limit it so  the response does not take too long
- Make sure that all production files that are published are minified and compressed (dist/, loader/, storybook-static/)
- in Deployments.md: if a dev is changing the content and pushing to the repo, might we run into merge-conflicts? if yes, how could build_release_urls.js handle these?
- decide if we should fix dependencies/devDependencies in package json. If so, which ones? Why? Probably fix to minor version? Or Major?
- Add yml linter (for .travis.yml)
- Modify content of sustainability-policy file to match our own vision and policies.
- The release-badge in the readme.md file is out of sync sometimes...

## Issues
- If you commit a fix and the merge the latest master before pushing, semantic-release won't do a new release: 'The local branch master is behind the remote one, therefore a new version won't be published.' -> https://travis-ci.org/lyne-design-system/lyne-components/jobs/658782240

## Verify
- If a travis release job is running, semantic-release did not run yet, and a new change with a breaking change is pushed to master, what happens? Travis should not make a new release, but make another build afterwards with a new release containing both changes
- For how long are deployments saved on netlify? Forever? 30 days? 1 year?
- For merge checks on travis: make sure semantic-release and deploy does not run

## SemVer
We use semantic versioning
