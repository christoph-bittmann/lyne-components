> and are based on standard compliant [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/specs)
> compiled by StencilJS and browsable through Storybook

## Todo
- Rename package name to "lyne-components"
- Decide for Branching-Model
- Add Merge Checks
- Add Linter
- Repo -> Insights -> Community -> Fullfill checklist
- Semantic-release updates version in package.json, but in the package-lock.json it does not
- Prevent push to master
- In Storybook build: ommit webpack verbose mode since it is logging too much uniformative stuff
- Documentation (update / add)
  - RELEASING.md
  - DEVELOP.md
  - .github
- npm script ```start``` runs stencil and storybook in parallel. We need sequential. Problem is that ```start:stencil``` has no exit code since it is serving and watching, so the second sequential command ```start:storybook``` is not run. Quick fix is to run them parallel.
- In Storybook, css changes are not updated in watch mode
- Different secrets and env-variables on git, travis and netlify.
  - Document exactly which key is needed for what and where to generate it
  - Before production: regenerate all keys
- refactor build_release_urls.js with promises
- optimize storybook build (check .min...)
- for DEPLOYMENTS.md: in which timezone should we format the date?
- DEPLOYMENTS.md might get large over time. Should we limit it to x releases?
- ommit output when netlify_deploy.sh is called on travis
- update documentation to adhere to the latest changes
- add the node command for DEPLOYMENTS.md used in travis job to a shell script
