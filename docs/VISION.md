# Lyne Design System — Vision

## tl;dr
The reference and building blocks to create consistent experiences across SBB digital products in a sustainable fashion with long term commitment.

## What *Lyne* is and why we need it
The *[Lyne Design System](./GLOSSARY.md#lyne)* is a holistic approach towards a consistent, maintainable, cross-company design language for all SBB digital products/services for a better common understanding between stakeholders, designers and developers.


## What *Lyne* consists of
It is based on a intuitive, unique — the [Single Source of Truth](./GLOSSARY.md#lyne) — referential resource, including shared and well-documented guidelines, [terminologies](./GLOSSARY.md), processes and vocabulary ([Design Tokens](./GLOSSARY.md#design-token)), as well as centralised, vendor and framework agnostic basic building blocks ([Lyne Components](./GLOSSARY.md#lyne-components)).


## What *Lyne* does
The system not only enables an optimised collaboration and integration workflow between the [Design System Core Team](./GLOSSARY.md#design-system-core-team) and consumers of *[Lyne Design System](./GLOSSARY.md#lyne)* but also accelerates the creation and development process (time to market) in a sustainable, maintainable, and long term committed fashion.
