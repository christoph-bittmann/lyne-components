Headings are used as the titles of each major section of a page in the interface. For example, templates generally use headings as their title.

Heading element provides an option to change the `level` of the heading. Heading also includes an option that allows you to make e.g. h1 visually look like h3, but still keep it h1 in the HTML markup.
