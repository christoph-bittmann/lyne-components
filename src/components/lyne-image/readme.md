| `alt`                   | `alt`                    | An alt text is not always necessary (e.g. in teaser cards when additional link text is provided). In this case we can leave it blank, but the attribute still needs to be present. In that way we can signal assistive technologies that they can leave the image out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `string`                                                                                            | `undefined` |
| `aspectRatio`           | `aspect-ratio`           | Choose from the existing palette of allowed aspect ratios. The aspect ratio can also change from viewport to viewport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | `"1/1" \| "1/2" \| "16/9" \| "2/1" \| "2/3" \| "3/2" \| "3/4" \| "4/3" \| "4/5" \| "5/4" \| "9/16"` | `'16/9'`    |
| `blurHash`              | `blur-hash`              | If set to true, we show a blurred version of the image as placeholder before the actual image loads. This should help to improve the perceived loading performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | `boolean`                                                                                           | `true`      |

| `hideFromScreenreader`  | `hide-from-screenreader` | In cases when the image is just serving a decorative purpose, we can hide it from assisitive technologies (e.g. an image in a teaser card)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `boolean`                                                                                           | `false`     |

| `loading`               | `loading`                | With the support of native image lazy loading, we can now decide whether we want to load the image immediately or only once it is close to the visible viewport. The value eager is best used for images within the initial viewport. We want to load these images as fast as possible to improve the Core Web Vitals values. Lazy works best for those images which are further down the page or invisible during the loading of the initial viewport.                                                                                                                                   | `"eager" \| "lazy"`                                                                                 | `'eager'`   |
| `performanceMark`       | `performance-mark`       | With performance.mark you can log a timestamp associated with the name you define in performanceMark when a certain event is happening. In our case we will log the performance.mark into the PerformanceEntry API once the image is fully loaded. Performance monitoring tools like SpeedCurve or Lighthouse are then able to grab these entries from the PerformanceEntry API and give us additional information and insights about our page loading behaviour. We are then also able to montior these values over a long time period to see if our performance increases or decreases. | `string`                                                                                            | `undefined` |
