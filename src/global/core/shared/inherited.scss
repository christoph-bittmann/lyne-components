// Here we list all globally defined and inheritable properties. Each Lyne component
// inherits those through the CSS cascade by default as long as
// lyne-components.css is referenced in the <head> of the app/site which consumes
// the components

// CSS properties which can not travel the shadow boundary but need to be defined
// on each component are defined through %host-component-properties
// in global/core/components/utilities.scss which each component needs to @extend
